# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN: Achieving 96% Accuracy with TensorFlow😎🔐

## Experience the power of deep learning with our Kaggle repository! We present a comprehensive implementation of a brain tumor detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow. Achieving an impressive accuracy of 96%, our code showcases the following steps:🔥🧠

### 1. Importing Essential Libraries: ✅
Start by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model construction with TensorFlow.

### 2. Setting Up Dataset Paths and Directories: ✅
Define the dataset path and training/testing directories, and establish the categories for brain tumor types.

### 3. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset: ✅
Read images from each category in the training directory, create a DataFrame to store image data, and visualize the distribution of tumor types.

### 4. Visualizing Images for Each Tumor Type: ✅
Display sample images for each tumor type in a grid of subplots.

### 5. Setting Image Size, Batch Size, and Epochs: ✅
Define image dimensions, batch size for training, and the number of training epochs.

### 6. Data Augmentation and Preprocessing: ✅
Augment the training dataset to improve model generalization using techniques like rotation, shifting, zooming, etc.

### 7. Building the Model Architecture: ✅
Construct a CNN model with convolutional, max pooling, dense, and dropout layers. Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

### 8. Training and Validation: ✅
Train the model using the training generator, tracking accuracy and loss over epochs. Validate on the test generator as well.

### 9. Visualization Through Graphs: ✅
Plot training and validation accuracy/loss curves over epochs to monitor the model's learning progress.

### 10. Evaluation: ✅
Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset, calculating test loss and accuracy.

### 11. Confusion Matrix and Explanation: ✅
Visualize a confusion matrix to analyze the model's classification performance for each class. Display sample images along with their predicted and true labels.

### 12. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score Calculation: ✅
Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each class from the confusion matrix.

### 13. Saving the Trained Model: ✅
Save the trained model to a file for future use or deployment.
